        <h1>Welcome to Hands Camp</h1>
        <p>Hands Camp is a series of personalized lessons taught by retired NFL wide receiver D.J. Hackett.  
            Each lesson is geared toward improving the overall skill level of the athlete by focusing on speed, 
            agility and footwork all while prioritizing catching the football.

        <h2>What is Hands Camp?</h2>
        <h4>Hands Camp is personal</h4>
        <p>
            Hands Camp is not your big camp with 50 plus kids running around for a couple hours on a weekend.  
            Hands Camp gives your athlete personal attention with most lessons being one on one and never having 
            groups larger than 5 participants to ensure quality.  Improving at anything takes time, this is why 
            hands camp is not a weekend outing.  There are three sessions per package each focusing on different 
            aspects of football while incorporating catching the ball into all of them.  Cone work, route running, 
            speed and agility drills, ball drills, and proper running form are what the hands camp experience is 
            about.  Athletes are expected to show up on time and ready to work.  Each session is high intensity 
            and athletes should be prepared for that.  Learning to run, cut, break and catch the football at full 
            speed is the biggest improvement any football player can make.

            <h2>Who is Hands Camp for?</h2>
            <p>Hands camp is for kids aged 10 and up.
                Hands camp is for all skill positions.
                In today’s football, all of the skill positions on offense as well as defense need to catch the ball.  
                Gone are the days of the blocking tight end or the running back that just runs.  The best athletes are 
                the ones that can run, block and catch.  If you can do all three you stay on the field!
